				<p>"Oh!" cried the one-armed captain, "oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we didn't see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick&mdash;as some call him&mdash;and then I knew it was he."</p>
				<p>"Did'st thou cross his wake again?"</p>
				<p>"Twice."</p>
